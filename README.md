# Fortune Cookie Challenge

This is a React Native app for a fortune cookie challenge. The app is built using Expo and uses AsyncStorage to store data.

## How to run the app?

Clone this repository and then run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the Expo dev server, which will allow you to run the app on your phone or emulator.

## Future Work

- [ ] Implement message open animation using Shared Element Transitions
- [ ] Add validations for the text input
- [ ] Add unit tests
